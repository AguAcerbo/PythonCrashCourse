    "# Chapter 5: if Statements\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python’s if statement allows you to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state. In this chapter you’ll learn to write conditional tests, which allow you to check any condition of interest. You’ll learn to write simple if statements, and you’ll learn how to create a more complex series of if statements to identify when the exact conditions you want are present. You’ll then apply this concept to lists, so you’ll be able to write a for loop that handles most items in a list one way but handles certain items with specific values in a different way.\n",
